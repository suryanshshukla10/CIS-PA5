Now i have to find how to add the numpy array for reading the files.

We have to read the readers.RigidBody for finding the required detail.

Lets try to print the result of RigidBodyA and RigidBodyB and see what will happen with them.

the output of the rigid body is 6x3 array. if we are having the same numbers in the orignianl file then we are done.

To check the original file, we have to open the Problem5-BodyA. in vs code.

In file B we have the tip as zero. There are 6 rows. 

Similarly in file A, ther are 6 value for 6 leds and the last value is non zero which means it is the value of the tip. 

So at the end, we have the option to store these values in rbA, rbB and tipA. they are going to be the numpy array and must be saved as constant values. 

So we have the correct result for the two values. now the next task is to define second array for the sample file. But before defining the sample frame for the file it would be better to read the file. 

We can look into the detail of how the sample file was read previously.


There are many sample files. So we are have to read many files. It would be better to first denote the sample file alphabets. 

We have A, B, C, D,E,F,
G,H,J,K
for the G,H,J,K these are unknown value files. 

Therefore we have the same file format as in the previous file. 

I should change the temp3 with some other file name like fileLetter. 

Now inside the file letter we have q, which tracks the file 

It is okay that the print is reading file name. But i don't now where to read the sampleReading?

okay the file is printing accorngly. I have to figureout the inputFile value. 
- Input file value should be something that is string
- It must be based on two values. 
- It must be in PA4 asg. 

Everthing looks good. the input_file is assigned with the PA5-first letter and the other name is given according to the file format
And it's working.  

Input file is working fine accoring to the file name.

The other function for showing the logging info is also working well. 

Now the question is that values we are getting in the function is correct or not. 

For that we have to check it with the input data structure. As given in the input file. 

Looks like it's same. Let's check the next few terms. 

It's having the correct thing. Only we need to check what is written in the input file 

Ns = Na + Nb +Nd =  16

Nsample = 150

name of file

Nmode = 6

if we assume that Na = 6, Nb = 6
then Nd = 16-12 = 4

And we have 4 zeros. 

there are total frames 150. that means for 1 frame there are 16 values so for 150 frames there are 150*16 =2400 values i.e. 2401 lines. 

yes there are 2401 lines. 

That means we have to run the code for registratio for 150 times. That also means we are going to have total 150 A values. i.e. k = 150
- And the value calculated by the reader need to be changed. 
- let's try to write 149 into our frame calcualtion. 
- its not working. 
- That means we need to make that loop 150 times. 
- The loop should be in reader. samplereading. 

-There is no number in the sample reading
- i added 150 in key range.
- now the function is working. 
- lets check the last value of - the line number must be 2401-(10) = 2391
- Both the readins are correct. 
- To get the frame we just have to enter the number like [1] = is going to give frame 2 and frame [k-1] = frame k
- I am writing this with frA and frB for frame A rigid body and frame B rigid body.

- This function is working well. 
- Now the next goal is point cloud registration and formation of the A

Point Cloud registration 

- the first step is to identify the two input clouds
- Second step is to write the function for those clouds
- third step is to verify that the cloud is working fine. 

- For completing first step, we have the first cloud for frA[k] and the rbA. 
- Above method can be repeated for finding Fbk
- Fak is the registration we get from the point cloud registration. 
- Now we have to write the point cloud registration function. 
- output of the registration function is T,R,t. 
- We only need first value 
- okay we are gettting correct values for Fak. 
- Now we need to multiply Fak with tipA

- now we have reasonalbe vector
- the next step is to store that vector into the list

For loop
- We are only calculating the vector for 0, but for now we have to calculate it for all the values.
- we can use for loop for that
- rangle should be like rangle(150) because of 150 loops
- put the variable k in it.
- then the A array must be 150 rows long. 
- there are 150 values it's good. Now with the same calculation 
- is the values of Fak changing with the frame or not? 
- it looks the value of Fak is changing. Because we input the frA as changing.

- now we can repeat this for Fbk. 
- I expect that the Fbk should be calcualted in the same way
- i have entered the rbB and frB for Fbk 

- for calculation of dk we need to find the required calculation. 

Instead of defining the inverse here, why not define a module for calculation of the invers of the function. the inverse of the frame, we can give the name as frameInv(R,p) and then return the inverse calculation as Tinv,Rinv,pinv which would be a great thing. we already multiplied the Atip with the calculated registration. i.e. Fak*Atip so it is giving the correct result. 

the only thing remainig is 

frameInv

-I'm taking the only input as T which is homogeneous frame transformation matrix.
- Then i will extract the R and p from the numpy array
- it's better to write the numpy array before 



I think the inbuilt notepad is the best place to write because it is having the most versatlility of writing down the things. And that's why the name is called notepad. Here we can write whatever is in our mind. 

TextEdit or the notepad is the best choice of writing because it doesn't have any unrequried feattures what are kind of daunting for me. 

This is the worlds best thing to write because it's the worlds best way to write only. No need to insert image or anything else. 

I can actually write an articles why writing in text edit is good for me. 

The thing to consider is that there is deformed surface and i have to find the deformed surface. but i don't know where is this deformed surface and how actually i can use it. 

There is something like using the Freg from the previous exercise but i can't find it using it as challenging as i have to use the new. 

One more thing, these projects are completed when i type most of the things, not the fact that without writing anything is going to be completed. The matter is that these things need more challenges and can only be completed once i write them down. 

If Ck is on some triangle then what does ck represents? 
Is it going to represent the closest point on the triangle. and which triangle is that ck? 

I don't know anything about the bounding box, so it need to be searched. But i don't know how to search for the bounding box. 

there is some bounding box available on the machine learning.

I can't understand as what we have to calculate first, the vector m or vector c. Because vector c can be calculated with the vector m.

Is there a way to do the PhD in part time?

PhD need to be done in full time, the other things like MBA or any other professional degree can be done in part time. But at this moment i should not think about the PhD. The focus is to write down what i have to do here. 

One more thing need to take care, its of taking care of the mac. Yesterday there was a spill on the table and it can be dangerous event becuause if my computer fails then i will go down. And i don't want to go down at any cost. This writing is the best way to organize the life. And i know that i can have a better life with this kind of thinking the only thing need to do is keep writing and keep working. Because by writing all the things gets easy. Should i call my mother? I just want to talk for 10 min. It would be great feeling for me to talk to the family.

I think Ck can be computed once we have the vector m. But then there would be proble of computing various weighting factors. 

We are having the same vector q and the c. They are calculating the same way as the vector c. But i don't know how their weighting factors are calculated. 

So it looks like sk can be calculated with the vector q and q. 

We can calculate the vec{q} with the help of the vec{m}. But i dont know vec{m}

Actually it looks like we can calulate the vec{m}. we only need to find the lambda. 

We can then find the vec{q}

There are 4 decimal places upto which we have lambda. Actually we have to calculate the lambda. There are 6 lambda we can calculate. 

There are total 400 samples point in the output that we hava to find. 
Total 6 lambdas we are having. 

Now we have to determine from the output that what are the other outputs that we have to determine. 

It can be determined with the output files. 


But there are 7 values from the next column. 

In the next output lines, the first three elements are {sx,sy,sz} next three elemements are {cx,cy,cz} and the next elemment is the norm of the {sk-ck} it actually tells the error between the two things. 

Therefore, there are 7 elemets. 

We have to find the three elements, Sk and Ck each of three elements and the lambda which is single element.

The norm can be calculated once. we find the Sk and Ck. 

The values of the lambda are fixed. 

As the values of the lambda is fixed, that means we have to calculate the lambda only at once. 

But how to calcualte the lambda. Or we can actually determine what is the chain between the three of the terms. 

Or alternatively, we need to determine the relation between the three terms. 

So if we want to find the chain between the three then there is only once way, it's to pick up any one of the term and then figure out what is the equation to find it. 

It is not fixed the number of samples in each of the file. In one file there are 150 and in the other there are 400. So i can actually start with the 150 samples and then write for other 400 points. 

Later in point i can then start with the dynamic points. So it's not that worry once we have the points, as we are required.

And the lambdas are also different. I can write the values of the lamda as our first assumption but that assumption should give the correct sk and ck.


So the matter is that it will give the incorrect answer anyway because we are having incorrect answer in the previous case of finding the closest point on triangle. 

If I can repaire the closest point on the triangle then only it's possible to get the correct answer. But still it's not given that the method of closest point on the triangle is incorrect. 

So first I will try to have a possible solution of the problem then i will get the things in correct order. 



I think by having the sequential equation of calculaion of Sk we can calculate the the number of terms required for the Sk as the output. 

If we will have the sequential equation of calculation of Sk then we can estimate what way to go forward.



-------Questions------
1. What is the meaning of Sk?
2. How the Freg is calculated?
3. what is vec{dk}?
4. what is ms?
5. How to compute mt?
6. How to compute ck?
7. What should be the length of sk?
8. 

So here i have to understand how i figured the. Sk and Ck from the previous problem. 

Probably i can use the past problem and use some kind of iteration to prove that whatever i am doing is correct.

There is Freg which i don't know. In this problem we are only introducing one thin i.e. using the Freg which is the registraton of the rigid body we are calculating the 

- Why we are calcualating the older registration algorithms?
I think with the older registration algorithm, i'll get some idea of how of performing the rigid registration. 
Because the rigid registration is the one that we are doing with the avergae values. The average values means average mode = 0

-How to perform the rigid registration?
There was some ICP algorithm used for the rigid registration. 
Also there was some points were calculated in the triangle. 
If we are calculing the closest point on the triangle then after calculating it we can have the set of points on the triangles. 
That can serve as some starting point. Initially we have dk vector which are great. Now we can have the ck vector. we need to find the sk vector. 
The logic behine Sk is not understood. 

-How the Sk was calculated in the PA4?
Actually whatever we calculated in the PA4 for the Sk, was incorrect. 
I don't know why. But that sk calculation was incorrect.

-What can be the reason for wrong Sk calculation?
Wrong Sk can be because of some error in the triangle closest point calculation. 
They were saying to use some brute force algorithm for finding the closest point on the triangle.
If I would have to calculate the closest point on the triangle then I would had done it with just centroid calculation. 
There can be the situation when the cloest point is not on the triangle or it can be on edge or anywhere else. 
But it's not that. 
we did the closest point calculation i think correctly. 
Just understad where is the ICP or Sk calculation?
